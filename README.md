## Features

-   Responsive, mobile friendly design
-   Interactive buttons and links
-   High quality, uncompressed images used
-   Website is SEO friendly and accessible

## Final Thoughts

-   Performance suffers from using too high quality images, ideally I would use file formats with better compression than PNG, such as WebP and AVIF
-   Future iterations would be better served using a more efficient approach with React and CSS preprocessor like SASS to prevent such long CSS files
